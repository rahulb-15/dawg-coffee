# Responsive Challenge: Dawg Coffee

This folder contains your submission for the [responsive challenge](http://faculty.washington.edu/mikefree/info343/#/challenges/responsive). The below questions should be answered with details about your submission!

##### 1. What is the URL of this site, as hosted on your student webserver (i.e., students.washington.edu/<code>{uw-new-id}</code>/info343/<code>{project-name}</code>) #####
> students.washington.edu/rbanala/info343/dawg-coffee

##### 2. Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who. #####
> I received help from classmates and friends such as Katrina Saulon, Chan Im, and other members of the TE Computer Lab. I also received help from my TA, Joanna Koseff and my instructor, Mike Freeman. 

##### 3. Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what? #####
> I did not. 

##### 4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge? #####
> This assignment took me approximately 8-10 hours of continuous work to finish.

##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better? #####
> The biggest problem I had encountered is that some portions of the challenge required skills we had not yet covered in class before this assignment was given. I would recommend that the assignment be trimmed to match the class instruction or to assign this project a little later when HTML and CSS concepts are properly learned.
